            In the rapidly warming Antarctic, two species of penguins are in dramatic decline.<br><br>
            That’s the news out of a new study published by Oceanites, a nonprofit organization 
            that closely monitors penguins and other <span style="color: red">Antarctic seabirds</span> , in collaboration with 
            researchers from NASA and Stony Brook University in New York.<br><br>
            Relying on satellite photos and on-the-ground analysis from more than 660 sites across 
            the frozen continent, the study paints a broad picture of the health of several Antarctic 
            penguin species: the Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, and gentoo. Like endangered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear"target="_blank">polar bears</a> , 
            penguins have come to represent vulnerability in the face of rapidly unfolding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"target="_blank">climate change.</a><br><br>
            The report looked specifically at the Antarctic Peninsula, which has warmed by a year-round average 
            of 5 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 60 years. 
            There, two species — Adélie and chinstrap penguins — were reported to be in severe decline. Meanwhile, 
            gentoo penguins appeared to be adapting to changing circumstances.
